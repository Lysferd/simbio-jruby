 Simbio JRuby
==============================================

----------------------------------------------
  About

 `simbio-jruby' is a JRuby-based application that works as front-end for the SimBio library.
 All calculated data is output as CSV files, easily accessible with most modern spreadsheet programs.

----------------------------------------------
  Requirements

In order to run this application, the following environment is required:
 * Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and superior
 * Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8u101
 * JRuby 9.1.2.0
 * RVM (latest stable version)

----------------------------------------------
  How to Install

Installation follows the procedure below:
 1) Install of Oracle Java on the Ubuntu OS

 2) Install RVM:
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

 3) Install JRuby:
$ rvm install jruby

----------------------------------------------
  How to Run

 Once everything is installed, move to the `simbio-jruby' folder:
$ cd /path/to/simbio-jruby/

 In order to run a single calculation, use `main.rb'
$ tools/main.rb ARGS
 In which ARGS can be:
 * --verbose or -v: application runs in verbose mode
 * --step or -s: application forces the calculation loop to pause at each interaction
 * --count or -c: sets the grid of cells, e.g. 5x5x5 starts the simulation for a cube of 5x5x5 cells
 * --input or -i: sets the stumulus current magnitude, always in pA, defaults to -5,000pA
 * --out or -o: sets the output folder for the data, e.g. -oDATA will output in folder `DATA'
 * --model or -m: sets the input model file, used only when not auto-generating the model

 Example:
$ tools/main.rb -v -c100x20 -i10e3 -oMyData
 Will run verbose-ly the simulation of a 2D matrix of 100x20 cells with input current of -10,000pA and will output data in MyData folder in the following pattern:
 `./MyData/100x20-cell/-10000.0/' <- all calculated data will be output as CSV files in this subdirectory.

 In order to run multiple calculations (not simultaneously):
$ tools/run_cablix.rb	<- for 1D
$ tools/run_matrix.rb	<- for 2D
$ tools/run_cubix.rb	<- for 3D
 Each file can be modified to perform the simulations needed by the user.
